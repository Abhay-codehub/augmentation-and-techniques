# augmentation-and-techniques

going thorugh different techinques of image augmentation

Image augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand a dataset by creating modified versions of existing images. This is often used in deep learning applications because it can help to improve the performance of a model by increasing the amount of training data available to the model. Reasons to augment original dataset include – reduce overfitting and make model less sensitive to variations to data.

Augmentation techniques can be geometrical like scaling, resizing, rotation or denoising (reverse of which is also an interesting augmentation)

•Explore different techniques to remove noise from images including (but not restricted to):
•Filtering: Gausian, Bi-lateral, Non-local means, total variation and others
•Noise Reduction Algorithms: Kalman/Weiner Filter and others
•Denoising Autoencoders
•Perform Literature Review and present exhaustive study on all techniques available.
•Write python script to denoise from image and video (in a single go).
•Extend scripts to apply result on batch of images or video (single shot). Benchmark against SOTA algorithms & work towards reducing this time.
